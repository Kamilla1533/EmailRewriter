Nobody wants to watch the movie for reality or blah. You dont watch movies for inspiration you would rather read books and biographies. Yes its true that some people are getting influenced and doing all shitty fuckery but just think. Anyone who takes this movie seriouslyis already a chutiya. And you dont go to theatre in india for some reality shit and if u really seek reality and logical scripts and characters without plotholes and all then you wouldnt be watching kabir singh. So I think you just made this for views, cause theres no need for this so called raw review. And one thing you acted like u forgot the movie name like seriously you know the whole story and you pronounced this overhyped mess wrongly? Oh common!!!😂"}

{"label": "Non-Aggressive", "text": "I literally cannot imagine a scenario where I'd be watching content from this channel, leave alone penning down a comment. I personally abhor this propaganda infused right-wing program and have reported it multiple times. It's in the best interest of the nation if it ceases to exist from the digital platforms and is confined to television only. Nevertheless, needed to get certain thoughts off of my chest so here goes: 1\\. Stop broadcasting these staged debates that resemble poorly produced b-grade flicks at best. The background score during the intro, the participants who are more like the bickering neighborhood aunties than dignified panelists, etc. stink of sub-standard nonsense. Stop fooling the public. 2\\. Instead of all this nonsense, why the hell can't you show how the PM and Home Minister have successfully confused the nation and are literally behaving like clueless self-contradicting juveniles? 3\\. With a few days left for 2020, our nation is yet to overcome the confines of religion. I had high hopes for my country and had started believing that we would achieve great heights in the field of Science and Technology that would put us in the big leagues, but no, we are all weighed down by this archaic concept (read religion) and have ensured that progress is a goal that is quite far from our reaches. A note to Republic TV: Instead of showing all this nonsense about anti-nationals, lutyens and what not please focus on key items that are deterring our nation (unemployment, poor economy,etc.). The mass does not care about the sub-standard reporting you do on these ridiculous theories. They want some concrete information that the news channels alone can provide."}

Secondly i didnt like arjun ka character- womZaniser, drug addict, alcoholic.and very abusive. Thirdly, by saying i like thia girl in particular clothing and then going from class to class plus the girl's hostel and giving it the name of love isn't love at all and it's CREEPY like srk chasing after kajol in DDLJ. Fourth point, after repeated pleas by his parents, he still drinks and smokes. He was shown in a negative light....but atleast there was a courtroom scene. And he is proud to say that while he was high none of his patients died? Seriously? He slapped a girl when it wasnt expected at all. He was very regressive. Not only regressive but spoilt, unapoligetoc and obnoxious. One time watch but yet inspite all this i could see the effort made by the makers. GOOD EFFORT... I DIDNT SAY GREAT FILM. THERE WASNT ANYTHING GREAT ABOUT THE FILM. ARJUN REDDY WAS as my teacher would say A SPINELESS JELLYFISH."}

I firmly believe the male character in Kabir Singh was irresponsible and doesn't have any reflection with real life or practicality. As you said in the later part of this video, \"if you're in relationship and your partner is self derogating then run as fast as possible.\" Don't you think this line defy your Joker analysis, where you appraised/empathize Joker's mental state and called the movie INCREDIBLE. But in this part you said to run ftom such type of person, if we all keep running from person who're mentally ill then were would our generation will end up. I'm not saying this all because I like Kabir Singh, I'm saying this because I have depression, anxiety and personality disorder. In the movie \"principal\" told the class about his Anger management issue. Kabir also has emotional/mental issues but I guess you didn't observed him precisely as much as you observed Joker. As per WHO, one in every 20 Indian suffer from depression; 5 out of 100. Hope you understand what I'm trying to say. Peace ☮️"}

Do you really think it is the right time for India to do an activity like NRC given the facts that almost 20% population are below poverty line and 30% of adult population are still illiterate which constitutes more than 50% Women who are still deprived of their basic needs. Do you think, this is the time such exercise would be of any beneficial to India? Don't you think the CJI and GOI has wasted our huge 16K Cr rupees in this unsuccessful exercise and if we live the money aside, look at the extent of trouble and pain people went in Assam due to this. The reason I Pointed to NRC is because NPR is nothing but Opening Step of NRC and with reference to Scroll.in(correct me if I am wrong) the new questions added to NPR are indicators of the NRC exclusion process. You being a Journalist and from Assam, doesn't this pinches your heart and raises alarm. Is there no value of human life on this land anymore? I strongly Oppose NRC, Oppose CAA amendment in the current situation. Was there any effective effort from GOI to stop the infiltration? GOI is just find ways to treat us like goats every now and then. I know, this questions should be thrown at GOI, however, as I see you a so called representative of the GOI most of the time, so, I am throwing this on you. Moreover, whats wrong with you getting stuck in this stupid debates on who told what. Everyone around us promote lies everyday. Nobody really bothers that anymore. Starting from PM to HM to Activist everyone promotes lies everywhere but no facts. So, Arundhati is no different, where we cannot trust the PM/CJI for that matter, who is Arundhati in that league. No one cares about her. I stopped watching your channel, just thought of looking over today for a change, but nothing changed. Same insensitive arguments and false narratives. I wish I could say alternate narratives, but I see them clearly to be false. Also JFYI, I supported the change in Govt, but really regretting now. I dont support any political party anymore. So, please dont ask me why didn't I speak during UPA rule. I dont have to answer that to you."}

I am surprised beyond anything to see the comments supporting your views and number of followers you have. Below are the points where feminists or a person of any gender with even a bit of a common sense are hurt- 1\\. When the lead actress is never asked if she loves kabir in the movie. According to you, in our culture women are not supposed to be asked? You can just impose whatever you like on her? 2\\. Forcing somebody for intercourse using a knife is a crime in our country, let alone the question of feminism in that scene. And for your kind information, liberals are not only the ones you mentioned. For example, I am pretty sure that you consider Nathuram Godse a hero for killing father of the nation, mahatma gandhi. In such case, you ll as well be considered liberal and so was Nathuram Godse. So don't go on spreading insanity you naive person. Just read more and expand your logical boundaries."}

Indians are not so mature enough to deal with that situation are generally countryside people join defennce that is ugly truth.

Father is abusive but Mother keeps quiet and lives by him regardless because she loves him. Actually the love of the women here is far more than the men. In this film the female character she see Gabir beyond his flaw that’s what the film is about. That’s why we need to see love beyond flaws. so Gabir Singh with with all his flawed character there was a women who still liked him. That’s why some people liked it. There were already many films like this already made in Tamil films over the last decade the idea was to appeal the audience with a male dominated character to show how an angry person who lives a gal madly and has changed over the time. The only film that showed this very sensibly was acted by Surya in the film Mohabbat Ke Dushman another film was acted by Vikram in Tamil film called Sethu which was redone in Hindi by Salman Khan in Tere Naam. Gabir Singh is actually a rip off from these Two characters nothing more also the female characters was also rip off from the female characters from these two films who were timid characters. So here you go the director got the idea of writing Arjun Reddy from these two films."}

{"label": "Non-Aggressive", "text": "Homosexuality : is it natural ?[困] Not to condemn no people, but to reclaim the fallen from this practice, is believing that you can be changed from that stage into a better stage ,to say that we will leave this one off & take the other, who are we to pass that kind of judgment on our brothers & sisters . The Question that should be asked is, where did this perversion of this deviation come about ? Cause when God created this universe & everything in this universe to obey Him & His law , the sun obeys the law under which it is created ,the moon ,the stars , this planet earth obeys the law of its creation. and what we see in the creation is no ,creature deviates from the law under which it is created. The planet moves in its orbit not disobeying the law not even , one fraction of a second & astronomers can bear this witness . i dont care where you find, an ant , a bee , a fowl , a fish. They all obey the nature in which they are created, men is not created to deviate from a certain nature in which he is created. the planet earth is created to incline to the plain of its orbit 23°c ,30 minutes ,The planet inclines to the plain of its orbit, this is a natural inclination or leaning. Man by nature is inclined towards the female & the female by nature leans towards the man. Now i want to know ,where did this , deviation come from? it was not until a man that was made years ago ,from the original man ,made opposite to the nature of the natural man, made to deviate from the natural way of God & man ,made an opposser of the natural way & deviates from the natural course, His whole life style will be a deviation. The Bible clearly says ,he changed the \"TRUTH\" of God into a lie & when you pervert the truth of God & make it a lie ,than what follows from that is a system of perversion of deviation. we didn't have brothers in Africa walking around with broken wrists . since people were taught and learned of this behavior we can un-learn this behavior. Scripture says \"as a man thinketh so is he \" if you make a man to think like a woman ,We have seen that \"Thought\" is so powerful it projects itself totally on the man's brain & it begins to reshape the material so that a man ,who thinks like a woman , his face, his features, his movements everything about him begins to change according to his thoughts. So scripture says \" behold I the sovereign Lord, make all things new\" so we must get ride of the deviation and bring man back into the natural order in which he is created & the only way to do that is to place in mans brain a new thought & that new thought will bring up a new idea and that new idea will reshape the \"matter\" of the man ,change the form of the man & change the expression of the man. There is no such thing as a homosexual that cannot be changed ,there is no such thing as a \"lesbian\" that cannot be changed, God is here to change us all up ,into a new growth & bring us back to the natural order in which we were created."}

Next I have made physical relationship with men who were or still they are working with defence forces. So no one can come forward and say that in defence we have no homosexual. There are but they are in closet. Second there are many news where soldiers abused or physically harassed girls so no one can say that if homosexual will join defence so they will tease the or harass the straight soldiers. Homosexual people are normal they are not prostitute who need Sex all the time.

We all were happy and had provided some gifts in the form of money and material to (as per their demand) bridegroom's. After few days of marriage she was beaten by her husband and in laws for dowry. We tried many times very carefully because we are from Brahmin society and we can't break marriage. Then after we gone to many times police action and other things but when we go for these actions they become innocent and after few days they again start doing beating and torture to my sister. One day she told \"Bhaiya if I will stay few more day, I will die because of their torture and painless beat\". Then I have decided to go for police and justice. We have lodged FIR after so many resistance of police. We have almost 10-12 wandered for FIR. In May 2017 finally FIR done. But then police took lot of money from them. Police didn't took single action against them so that they can feel guilty about their did. HOW CAN ANYONE SAY POLICE WILL TAKE ACTION SERIOUSLY? NOW POLICE HAS MORE CHANCE TO DO CURRUPTION. IN INDIA DOWRY IS STATUS. I CAN BET 99.99% OF MARRIAGE CASE BOY WILL NOT MARRIED WITH GIRL WITHOUT DOWRY. BECAUSE DOWRY IS NOT ONLY DOWRY IT'S STATUS QUOE AS WELL."}

I have same thought as you but i call myself as liberal. Dude your thoughts are liberals. Most of the thing you said about liberal is not true . Things like nudity and stuff. Indigenous tribe who live naked doesn't know anything. So i dont expect you to tell me what to wear. 2\\. Vedas are bullshit. Do u think god wrote the vedas? I am an atheist. If u start questioning vedas you will find it just a book written by prosperous people to control the entire community. How can u relate Mathematics with vedas? Pls dont tell me calculus was invented by vedas. 3\\. people of indus valley civilization didn't have any Hindu gods. Vedas are written after indus valley civilization. And zero was in use in Nile Valley Civilizations too. I can't say who used it first. 4 . Liberals oppose war. And you think its a bad thought. On man oh man.. god save me although i dont believe in god. 5\\. Vietnam war ......? Seriously... Do u know anything about Vietnam war? 6\\. I respect aadiwasi ritual and belief system. Far more logical than hindus but मुझे आदिवासियों के अंधविशवासों प्र विश्वास नहीं। इसलिए मै खुद को conservative नहीं कह सकता आपकी liberal वाली defination से मै खुद को liberal भी नहीं कह सकता क्यों की liberal वह नहीं जो आप बता रहे हो। I love my country and my indigenous culture . The thing is we liberals respect every country and their culture.. लेकिन कहना तो सिर्फ इतना है कि यदि रीति रिवाजों में कुछ कमिया है तो उसको सुधार कर नई अeच्छी बातो को अपनाओ।"}

And on top of it in your own words you said that it is not necessary that men should always be portrayed as saints in movies accordingly it is not necessary that women should be projected as pure and innocent! Since men have enjoyed the screen space in movies from the inception of movies and gotten away with projected as heroic and manly for molesting, suppress or objectifying women, let our leading ladies have the fun!! Or else let wrong be wrong , no matter which sex it comes from and stay neutral rather than justifying a male character and further inflating male ego and their superiority complex!! But on a more serious note I don’t think every liberals or feminists comes from a place of hating men just like how every conservative does not come from a place of hating women!! Let night he ideologies be used where they are needed!! Why do people have to be so rigid, timid and regressive as well as extremists in following an ideology ( liberal or anti-liberal) for that matter!!! Let’s be more welcoming of change for better and accommodating of age old traditions which are actually good and holistic!!"}

He said, \"Kabir Singhactually applauds its pathetic protagonist, and ends up an obnoxious celebration of toxic masculinity.\"[46] Kunal Guha of Mumbai Mirror rated the film two-and-a-half stars out of five, feeling that trimming the script by forty minutes would have helped.[47] Arnab Banerjee of Deccan Chroniclerated the film 1.5 stars out of 5, writing, \"Besides it's misogyny that gives its \"hero\" the right to make decisions on behalf of his girlfriend, and even kiss her as and when he pleases, there is yet another major problem with the film: Shahid Kapoor.\" IN SAB FALTU LOGO KI REVIEW KARNE WALI BAATE KAALPANIK HAI INKA KISI BHI ACHHI MOVIE KE REVIEW SE KOI SAMBHADH NAHI HAI.

It's true that if Kabir Singh was a girl this film wouldn't have worked, we need to accept both sides of the coin. And I'm pretty sure that if this was a girl's story the girls would be defending and ladko ki jalti buri wali. Anyway, I don't morally judge, and you are absolutely right in your review. It's a good film with raw and well shaped characters and i appreciate their effort. 🙂"}

{"label": "Covertly-Aggressive", "text": "Hello Pratik, You have said in multiple videos about the importance of having an opinion and the right to express that. Now an opinion depends on different thoughts, situations,beliefs,background,relationships,experiences etc on a very personal level. Difference on every aspect of life is the beautiful essence of the very existence of human being. I, personally agree with many of your thoughts but at the same time dont agree with some opinions. My question is why is it so important to put a tag or lebelize the ones who have different thoughts or dont agree with yours point of view? Why does everybody (who dont share the opinions as yours) have to be a 'feminazi', 'liberal' etc? Dont you think we should be respectful and polite to viewers ( more so because we are all educated and well read people) in a public domain? Aggression is good when applied cleverly and certainly not in unidimensional rage. Where is the Pratik who used to review The Apu Trilogy with love, care and utmost sincere humility?"}

I watched the movie today and I don't feel that it's anyway hurting 'the so- called feminist ego'. Instead the entire movie is all about acknowledging the character Kabir's issues, faults mistakes, failures and his unconditional love for Preeti. The culmination of the movie speaks for itself.. wherein a changed Kabir, fully in realisation of his blunders finally meets his love of his life Preeti, who is Not The Victim but the final and true saviour of Kabir. I really don't support the so-called feminism which is now seen hovering in the air. Instead I support true feminism--equality for both the sexes, male as well as female without any kind of discrimination on any ground. Also, negative values are negative for everyone.. Irrespective of men and women."}

{"label": "Non-Aggressive", "text": "Homosexuality is prohibited in almost every major religion. So we should not follow western culture(even banned in Christianity). Our creator, the Almighty has made our metabolism in such a way that we can only get attracted or do marrige from our opposite sex person. So a big misconception is cleared here that homosexuality comes from our ancestor's genes. Earlier there was a hypothesis by a scientist who said that it may be genetic but later on it was discovered that the scientist himself was a gay(psychologically not genetically). When people break the laws of nature(like having sex with multiple persons of their opposite sex) their mind later gets diverted to people of their own gender(like in western countries earlier, there were so called mistresses 10 or 15 for a single man) who fulfill the needs of wives for him alone. So, its our fault that we had multiple relationships which made us psychologically so ill that we started getting intrest in our own gender people also. God never made us like this nor he will. We are breaking the rules of nature. It is also scientically proven that having a single partner and enjoying a sex life with him/her throughout your life rather than being a playboy or playgirl(sorry for the words) make us a better human being in terms of both gender and obeying God's commandments. So homosexuality is a sin in almost every religion and we should not legal it in India. We should teach our future generations to have respect for their opposite gender person(especially to boys) so that they do not develop a mindset that girls are made for having fun(this will harm that boy psychologically later), he may start finding intrest in his male friends just to complete his fantasies. Same apply for girls. We should get bounded to the rules made by nature and find a single life partner for us whom we can persue our sexual and spiritual life. At last I would complete my stand by saying that God says us to follow the Truth rather than to follow people who speak that homosexuality should be legal in India on behalf of their democracy. Nothing is bigger than the Nature given laws and the Truth of life. Peace ✌"}

{"label": "Non-Aggressive", "text": "Totally agreed with your practicality but there are many subtle things that actually shows how bad the character is and how he suffers for that. You actually said a lot of things wrong: 1\\. He understands how wrong his attitude is 2\\. Looses his license even though he could have lied and won the case; this shows how the character matures and starts to remorse his attitude 3\\. He is a kind of person who runs away from a complex situation but at the end he never wanted to bring that as an excuse (had it not been his friend, girl would have never known). He did wrong and he realised. 4\\. Totally wrong when you say he is abusing his parents. The ending parts shows how his relation with father changed. 5\\. Totally wrong when you say he used to stalk that girl even after breakup. He never does that even though he is unable to move on 6\\. If u see the movie you will understand how he started hating himself. A man who is narcissistic by nature when he starts to be ashamed of his personality and attitude, its a very big positive change. 7\\. Okay i agree he ends up getting the girl in a very unrealistic way, but the scene where he is ready to accept the baby and give him a father without anything spoken shows the purity in his love (i agree the ripening of the relationship was very bollywood typical though) 8\\. yes agreed that he was self harming but nowhere did he let the girl know about it and hence force her to take any decisions based on that. The person is fake masculine i agree but not manipulative so you cant call it abusive relationship. 9\\. This guy cares so much about the girl that he rubs her shoulder after removing her heavy bag. 10\\. The girl had equal domination rights in him as well. She slaps him when he was out of control angry in a public place and he starts to apologise. I am sorry I do see a trait of matured and very mentally intimate relationship here. 11\\. I agree his background was typical bollywood but again as you mentioned if he was not so pampered he would not have done all the blunders (a humble background would end up seeing him in jail and maybe a underworld don biography can be written after that), so to give the film all the colours he had to belong to a family of means. How about 50 shades of grey as an example ! 12\\. Apparently he never reads(according to you) but how about the fact that he took her and taught her a lot during a song and never tried to take advantage of her (she made the first move which shows her agreement). Its also shown even though he tries to be masculine he never really could face the girl for long, he was not comfident till the girl agreed. 13\\. You need to agree that girl enjoyed the character and hence he could be what is portrayed. And hence like kabir (which i do consider a realistic flawed person), preeti is also a very real character, silent but manipulative. 14\\. Regarding that sex scene. Thats a typical example of rape. Many rapist actually raped when they were mentally unstabled adding physical needs (hormones) on top of that. But he says he is sorry and leaves (he dis wrong but he realises, isnt that good? Isnt that what a normal person should do?) 15\\. He is tharki? Yes he is ... its his sadness mixed with hormones, a very typical situation of being desparate. But that same person never wanted to go into a fake relationship, isnt that honesty and maturity? He never wanted to hurt anyones feelings like his were hurt. All he wants is sex! Isnt that what hookup culture is in modern Metros? People hookup even without any mental desparation, just for fun. Why is that not a very real situation then? Please feel free to couter attack me with a debate. But till then your reviews are as flawed and biased as the charecter of kabir. Ps. I am a big fan of ur work and not a narcissist sympathizer. Dont worry man todays youth gets enough dose of dumb sexual contents. They are gullable. And sex sells, thats truth, hence is sold by bollywood. Kabir singh dint sell dumb sex atlst and is a masterpiece for acting skills. Maybe watch Vijaya dervakonda in arjun reddy. Takes a lot of effort to get in the shoes of those villain charecters, should appreciate that before calling it garbage. Ranvir was great actor since his charecter lost in padmavati but shahid is shit because his charecter finally gets love? Totally hypocrisy"}

When a kid in his teens sees one of these so called \"romantic bollywood films\", it is bound to play with his mind. In this scenario, i certainly won't blame the directors or producers, because I'm sure they may have great scripts, but the audience in India is such that they dont want to see that. They don't support it, they dont like it. They want to see that typical \"mirchi masala\" movie and they dont want to think beyond that. In such a situation, the cinema industry has no option but to comply with them. I think its high time we open up our narrow thinking. I saw Joker yesterday, and oh boy was that a masterpiece. I find it hard to believe that we dont have such brilliant ideas, but bringing it to the big screens is the biggest problem. I can do nothing but hope that one day, bollywood moves on and gives a chance to better projects. Kudos!"}

Hollywood produce more volger movies. Even today American are not very much interested in frmale oriented movies that is why female centric flims fail meserabiliy at box office. Preeti character like character can be seen in Hollywood movie eg bella from twilight Anastasia from fifty shades of grey. These woman dont have standing character they often under the influence pf their male partners. Such girls do exist. Kabir singh movie became controversial in north only the audience in south had no problems with the movie. There are lot of movies released with more sexual assaults and violance than kabir singh then why everyone is after kabir singh. Movies don't encourage violence their are lot of violence happen in real world. Flim is a media that represents to the audience that this type of violence do occur. Person with mental issues behave violently even with the influence of movie. Blaming movie for mental issues is not right."}

{"label": "Non-Aggressive", "text": "What people don't realize is that if Kabir Singh made you feel uncomfortable, it was supposed to. It did exactly what it set out to do. With Arjun Reddy and now Kabir Singh, the director Sandeep Vanga is only exhibiting a different kind of genre by narrating the story from the perspective of a protagonist who's grossly flawed. For once we are shown the film through the prism of grey rather than the extremes of black or white. Because the story unfolds from his perspective, Kabir thinks he's the right kind of man, always in the right, wronged by circumstances and justifies his alcohol and substance abuse on the same basis, which is typical of any addict. Throughout the duration of the movie, he doesn't realize the fact that the fault lies solely with him. That it's his nature that's rotten, not his destiny. Throughout the film, we are shown his downward spiral into insanity, almost feeling a sense of suffocating hopelessness as though we too are infected by his self-inflicted agony. Vijay/Shahid both did a great job in conveying this torment in their respective renditions of the character. This misery continues till the very end, up to the point where we as an audience have given up any kind of hope of redemption for the protagonist, when he does a 360 degree turn by finally acknowledging his problem and sets out to seek salvation. I didn't find anything remotely wrong about this movie. The film doesn't in any way glorify the character. On the contrary it makes you feel disgusted and repulsed by him to the extent that you'd never even think of following his lifestyle. You'd completely abhor it. Personally, speaking from experience, as a person who's never had alcohol or consumed drugs or been a domineering misogynist for that matter, the film rather than giving me a wrong message instead made me all the more determined not to stray on to such a path. You literally end up begging the character to mend his ways. The supporting characters in the movie like Kabir's brother and his friends are all the while trying to draw him out of his ruination but to no avail. This film is in fact a very revolutionary step in Indian cinema, depicting a story about a flawed man, languishing in a greyish-dark space rather than lily-white or pitch- black. Usually our films don't go into that area. The film actually delivers a positive message that you can start redeeming yourself even when you touch the rock bottom of hell as long as you possess the will to do so. When Kabir is at his lowest point after being debarred from his profession and having suffered a personal tragedy, he is at the rock bottom of his pit and he has to make the choice whether he wants to remain confined to the darkness of the pit for eternity in a limbo or start climbing out of it. He does the latter and thus the film after subjecting us to a lot of darkness and discomfiture for most of its runtime leaves us with the teensiest glimmer of hope. Just like life. For all those who were unsettled and disturbed by the movie, as I said earlier, it was supposed to make you feel so. The superlative acting and technical expertise made the movie a worthwhile experience. I wish all these ultra-feminists and so-called liberals watch this movie with an open mind and learn to accept a posture distinct from their own. Especially since this breed cries hoarse when accusing the right wing of trying to distort history and current narratives to impose their points of view, when they are themselves intolerant to those of others. To deny that people like Arjun Reddy/Kabir Singh exist, would be denying the harsh reality of society. These are the same people who whoop and clap when Swara Bhaskar masturbates and abuses her husband on screen."}

{"label": "Overtly-Aggressive", "text": "Dear Pratik, Not all feminists and liberals go to extreme measures like putting down men and humanising terrorists and what not. The cultural values you keep referring to are ruining women's and even men's lives in the whole world and especially in India. Need i mention dowry, domestic violence, rapes, false rape accusations, lgbtq rights, mard ko dard nahi hota crap? You just bashed two communities because of the behaviour of some of its members which is exactly what you accused them to do. You are a hypocrite. You are influencing a huge amount of people what you just did was spread hatred. Did you know feminist actually means the equality of the sexes not manhating as you said? As for the review if you call slapping each other, bashing your partner's family, not being able to confront you dad about forcing you into marriage with another guy after becoming an independent woman(a doctor!) , forcing a girl on knife point to show her body, drugs, smoking and drinking excessively because you cannot deal with a breakup, performing surgury while intoxicated a heroic romance then god bless you. God save you. Sincerely, A feminist"}

Who stays confused in his life? I think you have not seen the movie till the last minute..Kabir Singh who was rude from the first he also cries at a time when everything was going out of his hand..so it shows hero gained some lesson from his past and audience should take this as lesson from the movie.

I don't say dark character should not be shown in movies but showing its consequences is necessary too... The problem with kabir singh is not with the negativity of the character, but with the people buying into the negativity. People are proclaiming him the HERO and is glorifying him as an inspiration! Kabir treated Peeeti as his Toy, his 'Bandi'. Kabir at no point asks preeti for her consent regarding his forcing her to be into relationship with him, which can mislead many men too, even lots of girls will find it cute too.. Imagine a Kabir Singh in your Life!!! My Problem is not with the movie or character but the character is so real that it can lead to birth of so many Kabir Singh in real life which is regressive to the society.. The character is celebrated as a romantic lead which is dangerous if subjected to real life, people are finding his actions , his abuse, hus anger cool.. his negativity is celebrated but thats really wrong.. his character is so real that it can provoke men in our country... Kabir Singh is a masterpiece, Acting is Fabulous, but In reality I don't support such person, but today's youth especially boys will consider this cool & heroic which is a threat.. Also if you guys have any problem with my opinion... Watch the episode of 'Satyamev Jayate' on Masculinity... maybe it may open your eyes."}

If a women is shown drinking then it is very bad and against cultural values but if kabir singh is shown as a drinker and smoker then we should be proud of the movie. Kabir singh is threatening everybody that preeti is my lady, nobody should come close to her and thats a morally right thing acc. to you. Wow, what hypocrisy. I know the movie is about negative side of kabir singh but unfortunately this side of kabir singh has been highlighted in a very stylished misogynistic way. In this film one thing is clearly shown that women should like and look for dominating and possessive lovers. If same role will be based on a women then u will obviously have problems, you will see it as a unculturable and non traditional thing. Why women should always be shown in submissive roles. 99% of movies in india are based on male point of view but if 1% of movies are based on female point of view, their liberties, why everybody has problem in that. This is true hypocrisy. Atlast i want to say.. this is purely my opinion and point of view. You may not agree with me and let it be. But please atleast think about it."}

When Kabir meets Preeti in the end, she tells her about her residence in some hostel and she worked in a clinic. Movies are not always meant to connect them with reality and teach us lessons ( I admit some movies do that). Some are meant to enjoy. The movie shows an excellent chemistry between two guys with some mind blowing romantic songs, how much more do you expect from it bro? Nothing is perfect bro. As you said person should ideally move on immediately after break up (in one of the videos you said in a slang way that, “khat khat move on karna chahiye mard ko\"), I am with you bro. But it would take 3-4 months for a guy and it’s normal. Kabir Singh here takes his time say 7-8months (not too much for even a fictional story), and then they marry. He developed smoking and drinking habit but even in that time he worked. Yeah one thing you exaggerated about medical students (they didn’t get time of all this). I being a medico can say that we get time for our relationships and we also live as a social animal. (I am not proving you wrong but you just exaggerated the fact)."}

He didn't not want to escape like a coward. And lastly he knew that he is wrong. He knew that, this is a phase in his Life.

{"label": "Overtly-Aggressive", "text": "All those feminists who are criticising the film did not understand at all the meaning of the film. Nowhere did the director tried to justify Kabir Singh or tried to portray him as a great human being. It's the story of a flawed character, his downfall to the path of self destruction and final redemption. Actually for me it's quite an inspiring story. We all have inner flaws and demons within us and are constantly fighting with them. Kabir Singh became a victim of his inner demons which led to his downfall. But its inspiring to see his final redemption after controlling all his inner demons. So I request all feminists to have some basic knowledge about films before trying to criticize. They should watch the Oscar Winning film of Robert de Niro 'Raging Bull' before judging Kabir Singh. As usual a fantastic video by you Pratik ji and by your sound reasoning u have given a tight slap on the face of all these feminists."}

{"label": "Covertly-Aggressive", "text": "The contemporary feminist lives such a comfortable life that she has the time to complain about such trivial nonsense like manspreading and movie characters being a little too masculine. And if she wanted to, she would make a video about the movie, degrade it to the point that people would stop watching it not caring about the hard work the creators put for it and a female host of her channel would laugh about it and so would their audience. But I’m the one who is sexist if I complain about it because according to feminist theory, I’m privileged and the power structure gives advantages to men. What advantages? They can’t say. And because of this power structure, sexism towards men doesn’t exist. According to feminism, I am so privileged that I don’t even have the right to talk about gender issues. All of my opinions are automatically invalid because I’m a man. I am a man – I am evil, I am disposable, I am privileged. The thing is, I actually do care about gender equality. I would gladly point out real sexism when I see it being done against women, something which the new wave feminists bafflingly neglect to do when it’s being perpetuated by anyone. But feminists don’t return the favour. Their narrative is that I am the cause of all the world’s problems and I have to be the one to change, to make sacrifices and give more and more to them because of this imaginary bogeyman called the “Patriarchy” which they claim gives me all the systemic advantages in society. The concept of a patriarchy is essential to their ideology and this core makes the ideology paint me as the oppressor and the villain and I’m sick of it. I’m not a catcaller, I’m not a wife beater, and I’m not a rapist. But I’m held accountable for the actions of the few men who do these things and that’s bullshit. And it’s exactly the type of bullshit being perpetuated by several social media sites and YouTube channels - the idea that men are the problem, that we should be ashamed of what we are and that masculinity is toxic and needs to be stamped out. Feminist may claim that they don’t hate men but actions speak louder than words. If you call yourself a feminist but if you agree that all of the things that I talked about are wrong, then you need to stop calling yourself a feminist. You don’t need to call yourself a feminist to be an advocate for equality. Feminism doesn’t hold a monopoly on that as much as they like to think they do. And if you truly value equality, you will drop the feminist label and stop trying to defend it because it is – destructive, divisive, counter-intuitive, and predicated on lies and misinformation. Feminism is bullshit and it is unworthy of respect."}

And in reality if people start abusing drugs than they'll become so unattractive bcoz reality will slap them so hardly and those drugs would make you go bald, loose those muscles, loose ur charm, loose ur social life, make you a failure in ur career and you won't even get that respect as Kabir singh got in the movie) Follow shahid kapoor not Kabir singh and to add to this statement I've to say Shahid kapoor went to gym and was on good diet for the role of Kabir singh so understand the difference of reel life and real life of the actors"}

That kabir singh is an imperfect human and we should realize every bad habit of his as bad and good traits of him should be appreciated too. Considering him so great, publicising him as a macho dude is in a way whitewashing every wrong thing in him and due to this i was very uncomfirtable.

But critically speaking, this movie is solely based on an individual's story. The name itself is Kabir Singh. Secondly, we have seen such rowdy and complicated female characters in Hindi Movies, just like Tannu's character. Now without taking any sides, I would like to state that movies should be watched critically, and should never have emotional connection if we want to review. And I agree with your review and your explanation of the movie. This time I honestly watched the movie before watching any reviews. And it's a good movie with good character development. Good story line. And it's a story of an individual. This movie is solely meant for commercial success. And I am also not happy about the over critical feminist reviews. Thanks a lot for this review."}

There are many things wrong with this movie like kabir Singh marks preeti as his territory without asking her, are we all guys not taught to ask girls out properly. There are many guys who think it's okay to act this way, because preeti did not have a problem. But what if a girl says no, guys will take on their ego and harass a girl till she says Yes. I have sisters who faced this. This sends out a very wrong message, and guys learn it indirectly. That's why everyone is fighting for it. There are a lot of things wrong with other movies too, but Lets not take that and defend this movie. Lets pinpoint stuff if anything is wrong to get better content which can be entertaining."}

{"label": "Covertly-Aggressive", "text": "People may criticize Pratik Borade by saying that he takes movies too seriously and always talks about ideologies instead of focusing on technical aspects. But ideology IS the most important thing. People in India are influenced by movies more than anything else. So if a movie is trying to promote negativity in society subliminally or openly it needs to be called out and criticised openly. Some will say \"Oh it is just a film.\" But many people DO take these movies seriously and it does affect as well as change their lives. So though I disagree with Pratik regarding some movies, I hugely respect what he does. Filmmakers should not be allowed to create whatever bullshit they want to manipulate minds of youths, simply in the name of artistic freedom!"}

{"label": "Overtly-Aggressive", "text": "<__URL__ misuse-of-laws?signed=true> women misusing laws against men in india for extortion, manipulation and revenge/vendetta has become an epidemic that not only threatens the moral fabric of our society but puts lacs of innocent men behind bars. lacs of innocent men are languishing behind bars in overcrowded jails, and there are no laws to protect them or legal body to hear their anguish and support them. our constitution states that we are all equal irrespective of caste, colour or gender. however, we have laws that only protect women and no parallel laws to protect men. in fact, pro-women laws are being misused to victimise men and men have no real recourse under law. we need to put deterrents in place to prevent misuse of laws, victimisation of men, and also to ensure gender neutral laws are put in place. #mentoo with pooja bedi intends to push lawmakers to draft legislation in parliament to create checks and balances in society that give men and their families equal protection under law and punishment to those who misuse laws. please note; #mentoo is not anti #metoo. women who misuse laws and file false cases are a deterrent to women empowerment movements. what needs to change????? 1\\. name of accused to be kept as confidential as victims name until proven guilty. a woman who files a rape complaint gets her identity protected but the men carry the hashtag of #rapist from moment case is registered. not just them, the women in their families be it mother, sister, wife, daughter all bear the brunt of his rapist hashtag. shockingly if case is proven false, no real punishment is meted out the woman who has destroyed the life, career, reputation of the man and put him and his family through mental, emotional and physical torture. punishment for the woman can be a mere 500 rupees.statistics are shocking. data by the delhi commission for women states 53.2% of rape cases filed in delhi between april 2013 and july 2014 turned out to be false. 2\\. rape/ domestic violence cases filed post 3 months of date of alleged rape/abuse to be treated differently and arrest only after investigation of the same. most fake cases are filed after deliberation, plotting and connivance with friends, family and lawyers. statistics claim almost 75 % of dv cases are false and according to ncrb data, 10% dowry cases filed each year are proven false. there are over 11 lac men languishing in jails implicated in false cases. in 2013, out of the investigated 1,12,058 cases, 10,864 were false. and in 2012, 10,235 out of 1,03,848 were proven false. after this data was released, the supreme court had observed that the law meant to combat the menace of harassment of women by their husband or in-laws was often being used as a “weapon rather than shield by disgruntled wives”. the ipc 498a being a cognisable and non-bailable offence only worsens the plight of those falsely accused. sections 354, 509 and 376 are there to protect women, and not to terrorise innocent men. 3\\. severe penalty to put in place for women who have been proven to have filed a fake case as deterrent to others. please note: there is a distinction between an acqquital on grounds of insufficient evidence and when it is a proven false case. 4\\. creation of national commission for men. if women have a body that addresses their issues we need one in place for men as well. data states that for for every 16 women who commit suicide 25 men commit suicide. 5\\. introduce purushdhan which will give a man the same economic rights and footing as streedhan. many cases are coming to light of women marrying men and within a few months demanding divorce and large sums of money. they threaten a man and his family under sections of 376, 354, 509 and 498a if they don't comply. the assets a man is given by his famliy or what he has earned prior to marriage should be considered his. only what is earned during their marriage should be part of a divorce proceeding based on number of years spent together and whether kids are involved. 6\\. right to prenuptial agreements currently pre nups are not legal as it absurdly gets challenged under bonded labour laws. men are increasingly shying away from marriage as it means extortion. clarity on money will bring rights and respect to both. 7\\. to clearly define rape there have been judgements stating that if a man is in a live in relationship it can fall under rape. promise to marry and not marrying is equivalent to rape. rape is a heinous crime and laws for it are stringent. we need to clearly define rape. 8\\. palimony to be taken as seriously as alimony. if a man is not earning and a woman is, he should be entitled to palimony with the same respect and laws that grant a woman alimony. 9\\. gender neutral laws to be implemented when men face domestic violence there is no law to support them even if they submit videographic evidence. same with rape. men on men rape and women on men rape needs to recognised especically when rape is defined as intercourse under threat/coercion. also for sexual harassment laws in the workplace to be gender neutral. men in india have been imprisoned not only by gender stereotyping but also a lack of laws and no official body to hear their cries. men are human. and if we want an equal society, equal relationships, equal justice, we need equal laws. please support our petition and lets push for equality and justice thank you so so so much"}

{"label": "Overtly-Aggressive", "text": "great initiative. kudos. all sides need a voice to maintain balance of judgement. but let's talk about most of the comments here that's like ' i take this golden opportunity to give slippershot to feminists'. kindly tell me, are feminists conspiring and encouraging women to file fake cases? how is this even a logical inference. people hear about false cases and simply assume it's just women exacting revenge or exhorting money. in reality, the reasons are so much more complex. majority of false cases (according to the delhi study) are filed by parents of eloping daughters especially if the boy belongs to another community or religion in order to end their relationship. and these cases were then deemed false because of testimony of the girl involved. false cases with women doing out of revenge is really the least common type. but people talking about false cases only zoom in on this type. truth is we don't really have much reliable post verdict data of all this. there's only this one study that too conducted for delhi courts alone. we need to press for more data and research of into this area (root causes) to amend the rape laws in a way that's justifiable. one of the amendments i would support is removing 'breach of promise of marriage' please understand increase in fake cases do not correspond to decrease in real rape cases. according to nhfs and ncrb reports not even 1℅ of sexual assaults even get reported. i have interracted with rape victims and inspite of all the laws favoring women, victims still find it difficult to navigate the legal and social system after a rape. they are very ofen shut up, threatened and shamed. there's a systemic problem of underreporting of rape. often in an attempt to support false case victims, people end up undermining the frequency and severity of rape in the process. it's a good thing, fake cases are coming to light and people are fighting for justice where it's warranted. but a fight for more fair treatment of men need not necessarily turn into a stupid fight against feminism. peace"}

{"label": "Overtly-Aggressive", "text": "**l am a male victim of fake female rape charges** there was this girl who came from new delhi to stay at my neighbours house with her cousins for a few weeks and we accidentally clicked and we began eating out, watching movies, shopping, etc. she would call me at night and we would talk and laugh etc. as we stayed in the same floor , she would directly pop into my house without knocking. fast forward, i was having a shower after my grindr hookup (a gay guy) went away, now since i stay alone, i don't worry roaming around in the naked, i was having my shower and she stood there watching me, the moment i noticed , she acted as if she accidentally saw it. this was so uncomfortable !!!! next, i began noticing my underwear being stolen , never had this issue ever. then this girl began spamming me wierd messages which got me pissed. then she left back for new delhi, she would video call me late at night in very revealing outfits and i didn't quite like it. but i never had anything in my mind so, i ignored it. the she began repeated visits all the way from new delhi to my neighbours (her uncle) every fucking weekend , and would simply enter my house. one day, i was having sex with my new date (a man) , thankfully, i kept the bedroom locked and this girl knocked it and stood out until i opened it , it was so displeasing, that we had to dress up fast and act as if we were drinking and having a good male time together. only to open the door and see her completely naked ,right in front of my bedroom with me and my male companion looking in utter shock. she didn't expect another male in the house since i was the lonely tenant. i realised this girl is a weirdo and i began locking my doors, would sleep at one of my hookup friends or mates or just anyone else's house at night on weekends because she would come to visit me, changed my number, everything. one fine day, she dropped in with her cousins and began shouting at me at my house by collecting everyone, and my father visited me all the way from surat , gujarat that morning, she kept saying everyone that i tricked her and had sex under the context of relationship and showed screenshots of me on my whatsapp messenger videos, what's even more surprising is that she took pictures of me while i was in shower oneday in the naked, she showed our lengthy conversations at night etc. she found my new number from someone in my office by visiting and stalking me and sent me threatening messages of alleging molestation and rape charges against her. i was so shocked and almost about to cry that i was being a friend to her as she was in a horrible marriage and having divorce with her now husband already, and that he used to beat her up and all that. i decided that's it's enough and i made my mind that i won't take this atrocious behaviour towards me since my elder brother was himself a victim of \"false rape charges\" against him , i collected the entire world including my relatives my office mates, my friends all over the digital world, the society members, and guess what ? **i came out as a gay man because i had no choice** i opened up about my sexuality and everything to everyone including my parents , my brothers, my boss, my teachers , everyone ! i was not going to take this woman's shit anymore. i showed all my sex chats to the world with all the men i had it with, called all the guys whom i hooked up with, showed all my pictures of me being gay ever since i realised my sexuality at age 14 and the bullying i suffered as a child. i didn't stop there ! i called up my ex and asked him to show the videos were we kissed, had cosy consented adult time together, showed proofs of gay bar visits in us , finland, israel and all places that i visited. and asked her if she wanted to really marry me if i keep having sex with men and be her husband at the same time, she was even more shocked than she could ever even dream of ! gay men (90% of the time) are masculine and you would never even know that they're gay until they say it themselves. most indian gay men by age 35 , almost 99% marry women to hide their sexuality. i'm of the remainder 1% who are proud of themselves. found out this woman had a child already 5 years younger to me , already. lesson learnt : never even befriend a girl or be her companion in her bad times, you might end up being called a rapist. lol, i can't even imagine seeing a woman nude , let alone touching her , i literally keep a hand on the part in the porn where naked girls are around hot naked men to avoid any visual encounter. my heart beats out for all my heterosexual brothers who have faced such female molestation or rape charges, even worse if they ever consensual sex , because the man is screwed now for life ! i saved myself because i was gay , ya'll have no hopes ! i also feel bad for girls who have been victims of rape by men, i won't be biased at all. women do face more of sexual assaults than us men do, no point in denial but there are many a times , men are victims of it themselves. imagine. showing your relatives, your sex videos with other people to prove your sexuality just **so that nobody calls me a rapist** i knew those charges would be useless but once an allegation always is a charge especially if it's a male. \"woh dekho wo launde ko, shadi shuda aurat ka rape kiya usne\" nobody would believe me even if i were to be free from all that legally. took quick action, saved my family from all that shame . i'm not ashamed of being a gay man, because i made my life out being called a chakka, hijda, what not by my own brothers, nobody accepted me not even my straight bestfriend as i grew up because i trusted them and they ditched me , as a result i began engulfing my own self either by suffering it or having sex with other men who would comfort me or play with me for some days in my teenage years and support me emotionally and cry lonely in the showers and beat myself ,cursing being a unlucky shame to the family. while my brothers who did nothing significant didn't have to prove themselves just because they're straight. many of my relatives distanced me since we are a conservative family what matters is my own family, took no shame of me. my employers know my hardwork, my friends know my value, my neighbours know my support. found immense respect socially. actually ,even more after coming out. my prayers with all rape victims of whatever gender, even more with the gay men because nobody even reports it if it has been done out of society. most of teenage gay men are sexually assaulted by their own heterosexual cousins or had some encounter. you have no idea the trauma gay men suffer as children being excluded from the world. drying within, most marry women by adulthood just so that their parents have their dreams fulfilled , drinking their own self sacrifice of being at freewill as venom. don't blame them, blame each and every indian citizen for that. imagine being a victim , where court deemed us as criminals, religions admonished us, families throwing us out, brothers beating us, our mothers love us but they have no choice . god bless you if you've read this far. i'm just like your brother, son, begin accepting us for who we are , this will save a lot of devastation from your own human fellow being."}

{"label": "Overtly-Aggressive", "text": "​@USER see, it is just my personal opinion , but it would be better if you do not use the over-used words such as 'feminist', 'male entitlement', and 'toxic' when you argue against this movie(or the mentality that has become this movie). the reason is that there is so much of bullshit that is attached with the definition of these words, most of it coming from the privileged but dumb american left and most of the issues that are raised using those words are concerning only the educated financially independent upper middle class white women. in india, where there are communities and citizens that have only slowly started to understand that women are also human beings and not just properties, we are eons and eons behind the west in the basic understanding of human rights. so when you appropriate such academic words to the indian context, there would be a huge distortion in the message you want to convey, not to mention the meaning lost due to cultural differences. where in the west their first world issue is to have the right to be topless in public, in india the public have yet to acknowledge the basic right of a woman to choose what she wants to wear. furthermore, these words have been parrotted within and without context so often, that it could mean just about anything but basic right of a woman for respect, dignity and freedom in the society, especially in a country like india, where there are women that belong to a wide variety of economic classes, not to mention segregations based on caste. what i have also observed is that the conservatives of india have also started to appropriate the words and arguments of the western conservatives, like 'libtards', to nullify such criticisms as against kabir singh. which they would do easily, because what they are basically nullifying is the dumb arguments of american left appropriated by the indian liberals. the american left liberals are nowhere near as rational or educated as indian liberals, leftists and centrists, while the american conservatives are far more progressive when compared to the indian conservatives( who are just a bunch of undemocratic dumb savages). instead of directly using those words in the arguments, arguing using the rationale behind those words, while keeping in mind the reality of how deep such discriminations are etched in the fabric of our indian society, would do more more good, i guess. not for the sake of winning the argument, nor in the hope that these dumb idiots would understand it somehow. but for the rational people who still has a flicker of humanity in them, to read such arguments and spread the message."}

{"label": "Overtly-Aggressive", "text": "i am a 27 year old gay man from a small town in up. i am out to my family and a lot of other people in my life, so it would be easier for me to participate in the gay pride parades, but the problem is these pride parades happen in big cities mostly and no where near me. however, lucknow started its pride march in 2016 and lucknow is near me, so may join lucknow pride in future(didn't see any youtube video of 2017 pride march in lucknow which i had hoped to attend). anyways, since i also wanted to contribute to the upliftment of my gay community i did the following: 1\\. i collected around 1400 mobile numbers of around 850 members of parliament (the contact details are available on lok sabha and rajya sabha website). and i wrote the following sms on these numbers: \"sir/maam, i am a 26 year old homosexual person from u.p. homosexual people have the same aspirations in life as heterosexual people. kindly change section 377.\" i received several call backs but i was too afraid to talk with an mp. though i chatted with some of them via sms. 2\\. then, i sent all the mps a very elaborate whatsapp message in pure hindi basically saying gays are the new dalits and homophobia is the new untouchability. i wish i had saved that message to show you guys. i basically made humble demand for acknowledgement, education about and protection of gays. this time i received even more encouraging responses. so far so that one of the mps asked me to visit him in his delhi office. though i excused myself out of it because i was at lucknow, with a relative and broke. but above all, again, too intimated to face an mp when i am a nobody and have nobody. anyways, a lot of those mps still send me messages on festivals, etc. 3\\. i also emailed every mp on their official email id, with the concerns of gay indians. and again received several positive responses. one interesting thing that happened is the personal assistant of one of the mps who must have read my mail called me and said that he has a gay family member and was asking me how to deal with it basically. now why i am telling these things to you guys is because i believe we as a community, the gay community need to up our game and be more focused. pride marches are great but i am sure it doesn't reach our legislature, judiciary or executive. so it's my request to reach out to our elected representatives in the parliament and the supreme court judges with smses, whatsapp messages, letters and whatnot. and also if you are a small town gay or lesbian, don't be afraid that your family will not understand when you come out to them. i am from ghazipur, a small town near varanasi and have a big joint family and have told almost everyone in my family and they all understand. we have to give them more credit. i came out to some verbally, to some through letters and to some through whatsapp message. i also have visited several doctors in small towns and have told them that i am gay and they all are aware and educated and ready to help. i hope my this rather long message helps someone in someway. (feel free to ask me how to collate 1400 mobile numbers in your phone, send messages in bulk etc. i have done them all and will be doing them in future also)"}

{"label": "Overtly-Aggressive", "text": "i knew it !! i knew that you were gonna ask me that as your next question. see. i clearly told you that the examples that i gave dont prove anything. so i did not imply that choosing or not choosing are related to normal or natural behaviour. its just that the statistics speak something. no one really knows what it is, all the way down to the fundamentals of sexuality. and by the way, bestiality may be just normal or natural. or it maybe just disgusting. but who knows ? maybe bestiality is just another form of sexual orientation ! buuuut. why should people be against it then ?? simple. because even though a person may wanna have sex with an animal, there is no way of knowing whether the animal also wants to have sex with the person. i told you in that previous comment that consensual relationships are nobody's business. animals cant give consent, coz neither can we understand them nor can they understand us. you can end up raping the animal. so that closes the chapter on bestiality and it must be forbidden. next question that you may wanna ask is: pedophilia ! so, again, pedophilia may just be another form of sexual orientation. who knows ? buuut again ! a child is not really capable of giving consent, isnt it ? that's why we have laws in most countries about the age of consent. some places its 16 some 18 blah blah blah. but its not 12 years old anywhere, i guess. coz most kids are just too immature at that age, even though different kids start maturing at different ages. no one actually knows what the right age is. maybe we'll never know. but its reasonable to assume that kids are mature by the time they are like 15 or 16 so that is the widely accepted age range of consent in many countries. but it is always dangerous for a pedophile to assume that a kid that he wants to have sex with can give him/her consent, bcoz you dont really know if the child is old enough to think about it. thats why sex with children should also be forbidden, well until they reach the age of maturity, as i have been saying all along. so if an adult wants to have sex with an animal or a child, but never acts upon his/her desires, well then that is fine and he/she should not be criminalized in society. there is a difference between a pedophile and a child molester. but anyway, you get my point, i hope. now i know the next question you are probably gonna ask, but ill wait for your reply to see if thats what it is. lol"}
